Welcome to the new mission, today we pull back the curtain on how the web truly works and introduce you to the powerful world of Node.js! 🌐



In this module, you'll gain a solid understanding of the internet’s backbone—from how a browser talks to a server, to the difference between frontend and backend, and why Node.js is a game-changer in modern development.



We’ll explore:

The magic of the event loop 🌀 and how Node.js handles millions of requests without breaking a sweat,
The single-threaded nature of Node.js and how it still manages to stay lightning fast ⚡,
How to install Node.js like a pro using fnm (no more versioning nightmares!),
And master the modular system that makes Node.js both clean and powerful—CommonJS, ES Modules, IIFE, index exports—you’ll cover it all!


By the end of this module, you’ll not only understand the “what” but the “why” behind Node.js and how it's structured to be efficient, modular, and scalable. Whether you're building APIs, tools, or full-stack apps, these concepts will level up your backend journey in no time.

## 12-1 How the web works
- Request Response Model / Client-Server Architecture

- https ==> Protocol
- web.programming-hero.com ===> Domain name
- success ==> Resource

- Domain Address is not real Address 
- real Address is api address in dns server as like 139.59.2345:443
